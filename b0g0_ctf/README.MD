# Results

## NOTE

Due to a technical mistake on my side, the CTF was not published in its final version for the first 15 min of this challenge. Since this introduced additional vulnerabilities that were reported before it was fixed, I decided it's only fair to also reward the first submitters of those issues and pay respect to the efforts of all participants. The pot for this particular CTF will also be x3-ed to 600$ as another incentive to everyone that managed to uncover a substantial bug in this challenge.

Below are the auditors who managed to be the first to submit a valid non-informational bug, regardless if it was in the [unfinilized](https://github.com/Egis-Security/CTF_Challenge/blob/e5fa79951e1b20c90d68d1cf071ccca81b51ea38/b0g0_ctf/BuggyNFTVault.sol) or the [finilized](https://github.com/Egis-Security/CTF_Challenge/blob/26b1cc25ac00177207ec25ab8ccc0a47ee8a26de/b0g0_ctf/BuggyNFTVault.sol) version of the challenge.
