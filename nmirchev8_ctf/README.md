## Summary
**`ExtraSafeExternalCall.sol` is a Solidity smart contract that:**

- Is meant to be inherited by other contracts.
- Provides a safe way to interact with potentially untrusted external contracts.
- Implements mechanisms to mitigate specific attack vectors associated with external calls.
## Key Points
**Purpose:**

- The contract provides a method to call external contracts safely, mitigating certain risks.
- It ensures the call does not revert and instead returns the status and any relevant data.
**Security Measures:**

- Gas Limit: Limits the amount of gas passed to the external call to prevent gas griefing attacks where the called contract could use excessive gas.
- Data Limit: Limits the size of the returned data to protect against gas bomb attacks where the called contract returns an excessively large amount of data.
**Functionality:**

- The `callContractSafe` function performs the external call.
- It returns a boolean indicating success.
- If the call fails, it returns the reason for the revert.
- If the external call succeeds, the data from the is returned.
